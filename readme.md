# üê∏ Welcome

Froggie is a Discord bot jam-packed with commands. Feel free to read Froggie's docs, which you can find at [docs.froggie.cc](https://docs.froggie.cc)! Froggie currently has about 40 commands, and is certified on [Discord.boats](https://discord.boats/bot/917288138156683285). Here's some help navigating this repository:
- [commands](/commands): pretty self-explanitory, this is the folder that contains all of Froggie's commands.
- [events](/events): this folder contains client events, which essentially waits to see when something happens, e.g. when a member sends a message, when a user joins a guild, or when the bot comes online.
- [img](/img): images that the bot uses!
